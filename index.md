I am a principal research engineer at [Living Analytics Research Centre](https://larc.smu.edu.sg/). I am from Indonesia.

I blog at [Elastic-ai.com](https://elastic-ai.com/), and my current interests include machine learning, natural language processing, text mining, and deep learning. I am a big fan of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/). I maintain [elasticsearch-head](https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head) tool.

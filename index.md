I am a research engineer at [Living Analytics Research Centre](https://centres.smu.edu.sg/larc/). I am originally from Indonesia.

My current interests include machine learning, natural language processing, text mining, and deep learning. I am also interested in [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). I maintain [elasticsearch-head](https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head) tool.
